        that is fermented cooler than typical ales and cold conditioned like a lager.
        ALT means \"old\" in German and refers to a beer style made using ale yeast
        after many German brewers had switched to newly discovered lager yeast. This
        ale has a very smooth, yet pronounced, hop bitterness with a malty backbone
        and a characteristic German yeast character. Made with 98% organic two-row
        and Munich malts and US noble hops.","abv":6.0,"created_at":"2010-12-07T02:53:38Z","updated_at":"2010-12-07T02:53:38Z","brewery":{"id":1,"name":"(512)
